# ðŸŽ¤ GeneKnow Pipeline Presentation Script

## Slide 1: Introduction
**"Hello, I'm going to walk you through GeneKnow - our genomic risk assessment pipeline."**

- Local-first genomic analysis
- Processes FASTQ, BAM, and VCF files
- Predicts cancer risk using ML models
- Built with LangGraph + bioinformatics tools

---

## Slide 2: The Problem We Solve
**"Current genomic analysis has three major issues:"**

1. **Privacy**: Cloud services store your DNA data
2. **Cost**: Commercial tests are expensive ($100-500)
3. **Speed**: Results take weeks to months

**"GeneKnow solves all three - it's private, affordable, and gives results in seconds."**

---

## Slide 3: High-Level Architecture
**"Here's how the system works:"**

```
User uploads file â†’ LangGraph Pipeline â†’ Risk Report
         â†“                    â†“              â†“
   (FASTQ/BAM/VCF)    (8 processing nodes)  (JSON/PDF)
```

**Key Points:**
- Everything runs locally on user's machine
- LangGraph orchestrates the pipeline
- Results in structured JSON for the frontend

---

## Slide 4: The Processing Pipeline
**"Let me show you the actual processing flow:"**

```
1. File Input     â†’ Validate format
2. Preprocess     â†’ Align FASTQ or load VCF
3. Parallel Split â†’ Two paths based on file type
   - Path A: Variant Calling (for FASTQ/BAM)
   - Path B: QC Filter (for VCF)
4. Merge Results  â†’ Combine both paths
5. TCGA Mapper    â†’ Match to cancer database
6. Risk Model     â†’ ML prediction
7. Formatter      â†’ Structure for API
8. Report Writer  â†’ Generate sections
```

---

## Slide 5: File Type Handling
**"We handle three genomic file formats intelligently:"**

### FASTQ (Raw sequences)
```
@SEQ_001
AGCTTAGCTAGCTACCTATATCTTGGTCTTGGCCG
+
#############################@@@@@@@
```
- Contains millions of DNA reads
- We align to reference genome using BWA
- Then call variants

### BAM (Aligned sequences)
- Already aligned, skip BWA step
- Go straight to variant calling

### VCF (Variant calls)
- Already has variants
- Skip to quality filtering
- Most efficient path

---

## Slide 6: Parallel Processing
**"Here's where it gets clever - we use parallel paths:"**

```
Preprocess
    â”œâ”€â†’ If FASTQ/BAM: Variant Calling
    â””â”€â†’ If VCF: QC Filter
         â†“
    Merge Results
```

**Benefits:**
- Optimized for each file type
- No wasted computation
- Faster results

---

## Slide 7: TCGA Integration
**"We match variants against real cancer data:"**

- **Database**: 2,828 patient cohort
- **5 Cancer Types**: Breast, Colon, Lung, Prostate, Blood
- **83 Known Variants**: Curated from literature

**Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT frequency FROM variants 
WHERE gene='BRCA1' AND cancer_type='breast'
-- Returns: 2.3% frequency in breast cancer patients
```

---

## Slide 8: Risk Prediction
**"Our ML models predict risk for 5 cancer types:"**

### Model Details:
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Features**: Age, Sex, Gene variants
- **Training**: Based on known associations

### Cancer Genes We Track:
- **Breast**: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PIK3CA...
- **Colon**: APC, KRAS, TP53, SMAD4...
- **Lung**: TP53, KRAS, EGFR, ALK...

---

## Slide 9: Technical Implementation
**"Under the hood, here's what makes it work:"**

### LangGraph State Management:
```python
class GenomicState(TypedDict):
    file_path: str
    raw_variants: List[dict]
    risk_scores: dict
    report_sections: dict
    # ... 20+ fields tracking pipeline state
```

### Node Pattern:
```python
def process(state):
    try:
        # Do work
        state["output"] = result
        state["completed_nodes"].append("node_name")
    except Exception as e:
        state["errors"].append(error_info)
    return state
```

---

## Slide 10: API & Frontend Integration
**"The pipeline exposes a simple REST API:"**

### Request:
```json
POST /analyze_path
{
    "file_path": "sample.fastq.gz",
    "preferences": {
        "patient_data": {"age": 45, "sex": "F"}
    }
}
```

### Response:
```json
{
    "risk_scores": {
        "breast": 72.8,
        "colon": 19.3
    },
    "variants": [...],
    "report_sections": {...}
}
```

---

## Slide 11: Performance
**"The pipeline is fast:"**

### Processing Times:
- **File validation**: 0.01s
- **Alignment**: 0.5-0.8s
- **Variant calling**: 0.1s
- **Risk prediction**: 0.05s
- **Total**: <1 second for test files

### Scalability:
- Currently: Process entire file at once
- Future: Chunk large files for parallel processing
- Goal: Handle 1GB files in <1 minute

## Slide 12: What's Next?
**"Here's what we're building next:"**

1. **Real DeepVariant Integration**
   - Currently using simulated variants
   - DeepVariant is Google's state-of-the-art caller

2. **FASTQ Chunking**
   - Split large files into chunks
   - Process in parallel
   - Handle whole genome files (100GB+)

3. **LLM Report Generation**
   - Use Llama 3.1 for natural language reports
   - Multi-language support
   - Personalized recommendations

---

## Slide 13: Demo
**"Let me show you a live demo:"**

1. Start the API server
2. Upload a test FASTQ file
3. Watch the pipeline process
4. View risk report

## Slide 15: Questions?
**"Thank you! Any questions?"**

### Common Questions & Answers:

**Q: How accurate is the risk prediction?**
A: Based on known gene associations from literature. Not diagnostic - for research/educational use.

**Q: Can it handle whole genome files?**
A: Not yet - that's our chunking work. Currently handles exome/panel data well.

**Q: Why LangGraph instead of regular Python?**
A: Declarative pipeline, easy parallelization, built-in state management, visual debugging.

**Q: Is the data really secure?**
A: Yes - no network calls, temporary files encrypted, memory cleared after use.

## Technical Deep-Dive Bonus Slides

### Slide A: BWA Alignment Details
```bash
# How we align FASTQ to reference
bwa index reference.fa
bwa mem -t 8 reference.fa reads.fastq > aligned.sam
samtools sort aligned.sam > aligned.bam
samtools index aligned.bam
```

### Slide B: Variant Calling Mock
```python
# Current implementation (mock)
def call_variants(bam_path):
    return [
        {"chrom": "17", "pos": 41276045, 
         "gene": "BRCA1", "variant": "c.5266dupC"}
    ]

# Future (real DeepVariant)
subprocess.run(["deepvariant", ...])
```

### Slide C: Quality Control Filters
```python
# Our QC thresholds
MIN_QUALITY = 30      # Phred score
MIN_DEPTH = 10        # Read depth  
MIN_ALLELE_FREQ = 0.01  # 1% frequency

# Only high-confidence variants pass
```
