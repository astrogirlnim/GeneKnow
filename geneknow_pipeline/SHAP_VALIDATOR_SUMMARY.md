# SHAP Validator Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) validator node in the GeneKnow LangGraph pipeline. This node provides automated model interpretability checks on ML predictions to increase trust and catch potential errors.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **New Node: `shap_validator`**
- **Location**: `geneknow_pipeline/nodes/shap_validator.py`
- **Position in Pipeline**: Between `risk_model` and `metrics_calculator`
- **Purpose**: Validates ML predictions using SHAP explanations and predefined sanity rules

### 2. **State Updates**
Added to `GenomicState` in `state.py`:
```python
shap_validation_status: Optional[str]  # "PASS", "FLAG_FOR_REVIEW", "ERROR", "SKIPPED"
shap_validation_reasons: Optional[List[str]]  # Reasons for flagging
shap_top_contributors: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]  # Top 3 features
shap_feature_importance: Optional[Dict[str, float]]  # Full SHAP values
shap_validation_details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # Detailed validation info
ml_fusion_model_instance: Optional[Any]  # ML fusion model for SHAP
ml_fusion_feature_matrix: Optional[Any]  # Feature matrix for SHAP
```

### 3. **Sanity Rules Implemented**

#### High-Risk Rule (>0.6)
- **Logic**: High risk predictions should be driven by pathogenic variants
- **Flags**: When high risk is primarily driven by benign/common variants
- **Purpose**: Catches when model is keying on noise

#### Low-Risk Rule (<0.1)
- **Logic**: Low risk predictions should account for pathogenic variants if present
- **Flags**: When pathogenic variants exist but risk score is low
- **Purpose**: Catches when model incorrectly down-weights critical evidence

#### Consistency Rule
- **Logic**: Feature contributions should align with biological expectations
- **Flags**: When pathogenic variants contribute negatively or benign variants contribute highly positively
- **Purpose**: Catches nonsensical model behavior

### 4. **ML Fusion Node Updates**
Modified `ml_fusion_node.py` to expose:
- `ml_fusion_model_instance`: The trained fusion layer model
- `ml_fusion_feature_matrix`: Preprocessed feature matrix for SHAP analysis

### 5. **Report Integration**

#### Formatter Node
- Includes SHAP validation results in `structured_json`
- Preserves all validation details for downstream processing

#### Report Writer Node
- New `_format_shap_validation()` function creates user-friendly display
- Integrated into both structured report sections and markdown output

#### UI Display Examples

**PASS State:**
```
✅ Logic Check: PASS
The model's prediction is strongly supported by the genomic evidence.
Top Contributor: Pathogenic variant in BRCA1
Does this align with your clinical assessment?
```

**FLAG State:**
```
⚠️ Analyst Review Recommended
Reason: High risk score (0.75) not driven by pathogenic variants. 
Top contributors: Polygenic Risk Score, TCGA Tumor Enrichment
Please manually verify this result against all available patient data.
```

### 6. **Pipeline Flow**
```
ml_fusion → risk_model → shap_validator → metrics_calculator → formatter → report_writer
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### SHAP Explainer Selection
- **TreeExplainer**: Used for GradientBoostingRegressor and RandomForestRegressor (fast)
- **LinearExplainer**: Used for LinearRegression models
- **KernelExplainer**: Fallback for unsupported model types (slower but universal)

### Feature Mapping
Maps technical features to user-friendly names:
- `prs_score` → "Polygenic Risk Score"
- `cadd_score` → "CADD Deleteriousness Score"
- `clinvar_pathogenic` → "ClinVar Pathogenic Variant"
- etc.

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing models or features
- Returns "SKIPPED" status when prerequisites not met
- Captures errors and returns "ERROR" status with details

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite in `test_shap_validator.py`:
1. Tests high risk with pathogenic variant (should PASS)
2. Tests high risk without pathogenic variant (should FLAG)
3. Tests low risk with pathogenic variant (should FLAG)
4. Tests missing model scenario (should SKIP)

## Dependencies
Added to `requirements.txt`:
```
shap>=0.44.1  # Model interpretability
```

## Benefits

1. **Clinical Trust**: Automated sanity checks increase clinician confidence
2. **Quality Control**: Catches potential model errors before they reach users
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Flagged cases provide training data for model updates
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Demonstrates interpretability for medical device approval
5. **User Experience**: Clear, actionable feedback in reports

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Rules**: Add more sophisticated validation rules based on clinical feedback
2. **Configurable Thresholds**: Make risk thresholds (0.6, 0.1) configurable
3. **Detailed Explanations**: Generate natural language explanations of SHAP values
4. **Interactive Visualization**: Add SHAP waterfall plots to web UI
5. **Feedback Loop**: Implement clinician agreement/disagreement tracking

## Usage

The SHAP validator runs automatically in the pipeline. No additional configuration needed. Results appear in:
- Pipeline state under `shap_validation_*` keys
- Structured JSON output under `shap_validation`
- Final report with visual indicators and explanations
