# Parallel Execution Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ LangChain Import Error
- **Problem**: `langchain_core.tracers.context` import error due to version mismatch
- **Solution**: Updated requirements.txt to use compatible versions:
  ```
  langgraph>=0.2.0
  langchain>=0.3.0
  langchain-core>=0.3.0
  langchain-community>=0.3.0
  ```

### 2. ✅ Missing TCGA Database
- **Problem**: `tcga_variants` table was missing from population_variants.db
- **Solution**: Successfully ran `create_tcga_database.py` to populate the database with:
  - 1,079,590 TCGA variants
  - 5 cancer types: BRCA, COAD, LUAD, PRAD, GBM

### 3. ✅ Missing ML Fusion Models  
- **Problem**: ML fusion models were not found at expected path
- **Solution**: 
  - Created models using `train_fusion_layer.py`
  - Moved models to correct location: `ml_models/best_fusion_model.pkl`
  - Fixed ML fusion node to properly load models

### 4. ⚠️ Parallel Node Execution Issues
- **Problem**: LangGraph calls merge node multiple times (once per incoming edge)
- **Partial Solution**: Added logic to wait for all 5 nodes to complete before merging
- **Remaining Issue**: State management is corrupted, completed_nodes list contains thousands of duplicate entries

## Current Pipeline Flow

```
Population Mapper
    ├─→ TCGA Mapper ─────┐
    ├─→ CADD Scoring ────┤
    ├─→ ClinVar ─────────┼─→ Merge Static Models → Feature Vector Builder
    ├─→ PRS Calculator ──┤
    └─→ Pathway Burden ──┘
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. State Management Corruption
The `completed_nodes` list is being corrupted with repeated entries. This suggests:
- Nodes are being executed multiple times
- State updates are not being properly merged
- LangGraph may be creating new state instances instead of updating existing ones

### 2. Pathway Burden Not Detected
Despite the pathway burden node executing and returning results, the merge node doesn't detect its completion. This might be due to:
- Timing issues with parallel execution
- State key conflicts between parallel nodes
- The pathway burden results not being properly merged into state

### 3. Excessive Node Repetition
The completed_nodes list shows nodes like `file_input`, `preprocess`, and `population_mapper` being added hundreds of times, indicating a loop or recursive execution issue.

## Recommendations

1. **Consider using LangGraph's built-in parallel execution patterns** instead of manual merge nodes
2. **Implement proper state locking** to prevent concurrent state modifications
3. **Use unique execution IDs** to track node runs and prevent duplicates
4. **Consider alternative orchestration frameworks** if LangGraph continues to have issues with parallel execution

## Files Modified

- `graph.py`: Updated merge_static_model_results to wait for all nodes
- `requirements.txt`: Updated LangChain versions  
- `requirements-lite.txt`: Updated LangChain versions
- ML models moved to correct location

## Test Results

When running the pipeline:
- ✅ TCGA, CADD, ClinVar, PRS nodes complete successfully
- ❌ Pathway burden results not properly detected
- ❌ State management corrupted with duplicate entries
- ✅ ML fusion model loads correctly when all nodes complete
