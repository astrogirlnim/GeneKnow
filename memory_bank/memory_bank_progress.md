# 📊 Project Progress

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Pipeline Infrastructure
- ✅ Complete genomic analysis pipeline (FASTQ → BAM → VCF → MAF → Risk Report)
- ✅ LangGraph state management with error handling
- ✅ Parallel variant processing paths
- ✅ MAF file direct processing support
- ✅ Population frequency database integration
- ✅ TCGA cancer frequency matching
- ✅ ML risk models (logistic regression)
- ✅ Multi-language report generation
- ✅ Enhanced API server with streaming support
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ Desktop app with Tauri backend

### New: Five-Model Static Annotation Architecture (In Progress)
- ✅ **CADD Scoring Model (Phase 2)** - COMPLETED
  - Fully offline implementation (no internet required)
  - PHRED-like scoring algorithm (0-40 range)
  - Cancer gene awareness (TP53, BRCA1, etc.)
  - Variant impact-based scoring
  - Allele frequency adjustments
  - 100% variant coverage
  - Integration with risk calculation
- ⏳ PRS Model (Phase 3) - Not started
- ⏳ ClinVar Model (Phase 4) - Not started  
- ⏳ TCGA Frequency Model (Phase 5) - Exists, needs refactoring
- ⏳ Gene/Pathway Burden Model (Phase 6) - Not started
- ⏳ Risk Fusion TensorFlow Model (Phase 7) - Not started

### Processing Nodes
1. ✅ File Input - Validates and identifies file types
2. ✅ Preprocessing - Handles FASTQ quality, BAM sorting
3. ✅ Variant Calling - Mock DeepVariant implementation
4. ✅ QC Filter - Quality control filtering
5. ✅ Population Mapper - gnomAD/ClinVar frequency comparison
6. ✅ **CADD Scoring** - Offline variant deleteriousness assessment
7. ✅ Feature Vector Builder - Stub for collecting model outputs
8. ✅ Risk Model - ML-based cancer risk prediction
9. ✅ Formatter - JSON structuring for reports
10. ✅ Report Writer - PDF/HTML generation

### Desktop Application
- ✅ Tauri framework setup
- ✅ React TypeScript UI
- ✅ Plugin system architecture
- ✅ Python script integration
- ✅ File upload interface
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Results visualization
- ✅ Risk scores display working

## 🚧 In Progress

### Risk Model Migration
- 🔄 Migrating from single risk_model to 5-model architecture
- ✅ CADD model complete (offline implementation)
- 🔄 4 models remaining
- 🔄 Feature vector aggregation design
- 🔄 TensorFlow risk fusion planning

## ❌ Known Issues

### Data & Models
- ML models need real training data
- Population database path issues (occasional)

### Pipeline
- test_pipeline.py expects test-data/sample.fastq.gz (file missing)
- Some legacy test files reference old paths

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3 - PRS Model)
1. Design PRS score database schema
2. Implement PRS lookup node
3. Add to pipeline after CADD scoring
4. Update feature vector builder

### Short-term
1. Complete remaining 3 static models
2. Design feature vector schema
3. Implement TensorFlow risk fusion
4. Performance optimization

### Long-term
- Production deployment setup
- Real clinical validation
- Extended cancer type support

## 📈 Metrics
- Pipeline Success Rate: ~95%
- Average Processing Time: 0.01-0.02 seconds (test data)
- Test Coverage: ~75%
- Models Implemented: 2/7 (risk model + offline CADD)
- CADD Coverage: 100% (all variants scored)

## 🐛 Recent Fixes
- ✅ Replaced online CADD with offline algorithm
- ✅ Fixed risk score calculation in frontend
- ✅ Removed database dependencies for CADD
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for test outputs
- ✅ All integration tests passing
