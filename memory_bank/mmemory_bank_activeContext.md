## Current Work Focus

### Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Immediate - Next 1-2 Days)
**Priority**: High - Core functionality must be rock-solid

#### Backend Integration Tasks
- [ ] **Rust-Python Bridge Enhancement**: Improve error handling between Tauri and Python layers
- [ ] **TCGA Data Download Pipeline**: Implement background downloading of reference datasets
- [ ] **File Processing Plugin**: Complete FASTQ/BAM/VCF processor integration with TCGA reference data
- [ ] **Risk Calculation Engine**: Connect genomic variants to TCGA population frequencies

#### Frontend Development Tasks  
- [ ] **File Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop UI for genomic files with validation
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Real-time processing status during genomic analysis
- [ ] **Risk Visualization**: Charts and graphs for cancer risk scores
- [ ] **Error Display**: User-friendly error messages for processing failures

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Next 3-4 Days)
**Priority**: Medium - Enhance user experience with intelligent features

#### Machine Learning Tasks
- [ ] **Risk Model Training**: Train scikit-learn models on TCGA clinical outcomes
- [ ] **Variant Impact Scoring**: Implement pathogenicity prediction algorithms
- [ ] **Population Comparison**: Compare user variants against TCGA population frequencies
- [ ] **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical uncertainty quantification for risk predictions

#### LLM Integration Tasks
- [ ] **Local Llama Setup**: Configure HuggingFace Llama 3.1 for report generation
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering**: Design clinical-appropriate prompts for genomic explanations
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Implement English, Hindi, Spanish report generation
- [ ] **Report Templates**: Structured PDF output with actionable insights

## Immediate Technical Priorities

### 1. TensorFlow Compatibility Issue
**Issue**: Python 3.13.5 not compatible with TensorFlow 2.x
**Status**: Using scikit-learn as temporary solution
**Timeline**: Monitor TensorFlow 2.19+ for Python 3.13 support
**Action**: Implement model training pipeline with scikit-learn first

### 2. TCGA Data Management
**Current**: API connectivity verified, 33 cancer types accessible
**Next**: Implement local caching strategy for offline analysis
**Storage**: Need 10-50GB for complete reference dataset
**Priority**: High - Required for clinical-grade risk assessment

### 3. Plugin System Integration
**Current**: Rust trait interfaces defined, Python processors implemented
**Next**: Connect TCGA processor to Tauri backend via plugin system
**Test**: Validate end-to-end genomic file processing pipeline
**Priority**: Critical - Core functionality dependency

## Development Environment Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Tauri Desktop App**: Successfully launches with React frontend
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment with core ML packages installed
- **TCGA API**: Full connectivity to GDC Data Portal (43.0 release)
- **Git Workflow**: Pre-commit hooks configured, repository clean

### ⚠️ Pending Configuration
- **TensorFlow**: Waiting for Python 3.13 compatibility
- **Reference Data**: TCGA datasets need local download and caching
- **LLM Models**: HuggingFace Llama 3.1 not yet downloaded
- **Test Data**: Need synthetic genomic files for development testing

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Actions (Start Next Session)
1. **Test Full Pipeline**: Upload test genomic file → Process → Display results
2. **TCGA Data Download**: Implement background download of BRCA reference data
3. **Risk Calculation**: Connect variants to population frequencies for initial risk scores
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error messages throughout processing pipeline

### Success Criteria (End of Next Session)
- [ ] Complete genomic file processing pipeline functional
- [ ] TCGA reference data locally cached and accessible
- [ ] Basic risk scores calculated and displayed in frontend
- [ ] All error cases handled gracefully with user feedback

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Privacy-First Approach Confirmed
- All genetic data processing remains local to user's machine
- TCGA reference data cached locally for offline analysis
- No cloud uploads or external API calls during genetic analysis
- Compliance with GDPR/HIPAA through local-only architecture

### Technology Stack Validated
- **Tauri + React**: Proven cross-platform desktop performance
- **Rust + Python**: Secure file handling with powerful ML capabilities
- **TCGA Integration**: World-class reference data for clinical accuracy
- **Local LLM**: Privacy-preserving report generation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Large File Processing**: Streaming approach prevents memory overflow
- **API Rate Limiting**: Local caching reduces TCGA API dependency
- **Model Accuracy**: TCGA reference data provides clinical-grade foundation
- **Cross-Platform**: Tauri ensures consistent behavior across operating systems

### Privacy Risks
- **Data Leakage**: Local-only processing eliminates external transmission
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for compliance verification
- **Secure Cleanup**: Encrypted temporary files automatically deleted
