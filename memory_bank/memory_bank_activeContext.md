## Current Focus
**CADD Integration Complete - Ready for Production**

The CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) scoring model has been successfully integrated into the production pipeline and is now available for use by the frontend.

## Recently Completed
- âœ… CADD scoring node implementation (Phase 2)
- âœ… Integration with shared population_variants.db
- âœ… Job tracking for CADD scoring runs
- âœ… Frontend API integration with structured JSON results
- âœ… Report generation with CADD summaries and variant scores
- âœ… Fixed all pipeline errors for both legacy and new flows

## Current Branch
`disease-risk-model-cadd` (ready to merge)

## What's Working Now
1. **CADD Data in API Response**:
   - `cadd_stats` object with scoring statistics
   - `structured_json.cadd_summary` with formatted data
   - Individual variant CADD scores in variant details

2. **Report Integration**:
   - CADD summary section in reports
   - CADD scores in variant table
   - CADD interpretation (Benign/Damaging/Pathogenic)

3. **Database Architecture**:
   - Unified `population_variants.db` with multiple tables
   - `cadd_scores` table with variant scores
   - `cadd_jobs` table for run history
   - Foreign key relationships maintained

## Next Steps
1. **Merge to main** - CADD implementation is production-ready
2. **Phase 3: PRS Model** - Polygenic Risk Score implementation
3. **Phase 4: ClinVar Model** - Clinical variant annotations
4. **Phase 5: Gene/Pathway Burden** - Aggregate scoring
5. **Phase 6: Risk Fusion** - TensorFlow model to combine all scores

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test with legacy risk model
USE_LEGACY_RISK=true python geneknow_pipeline/test_maf_direct.py

# Test with new architecture (bypasses risk model)
python geneknow_pipeline/test_maf_direct.py

# Check CADD data in results
python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('geneknow_pipeline/test_data/maf_direct_results.json')); print(d.get('structured_json', {}).get('cadd_summary'))"
```
