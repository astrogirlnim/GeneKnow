## Current Focus
**Phase 3: PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) Model Implementation**

Following the successful CADD model implementation, we're now ready to implement the third static annotation model in our five-model architecture.

## Recently Completed
- ‚úÖ CADD scoring node implementation (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Integration with pipeline metadata (uses benign/pathogenic classifications)
- ‚úÖ Cancer gene tracking from risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Feature vector builder updates
- ‚úÖ Formatter fixes for missing risk scores

## Current Branch
`disease-risk-model-cadd` (ready to merge)

## Implementation Status
### Five-Model Architecture Progress:
1. ‚úÖ Legacy Risk Model (existing, will be deprecated)
2. ‚úÖ CADD Model - COMPLETED
3. ‚è≥ PRS Model - NEXT
4. ‚è≥ ClinVar Model - Not started
5. ‚è≥ TCGA Frequency Model - Exists, needs refactoring
6. ‚è≥ Gene/Pathway Burden Model - Not started
7. ‚è≥ Risk Fusion Model (TensorFlow) - Not started

## Key Learnings from CADD Implementation
1. **Use existing metadata**: Don't hardcode gene lists, use pipeline state
2. **Graceful degradation**: Handle missing data without failing pipeline
3. **Comprehensive logging**: Track cancer genes, pathogenic variants
4. **Database pattern**: SQLite for local cache, remote fallback for misses
5. **Risk weight normalization**: PHRED scores ‚Üí 0-1 scale with thresholds

## Next Implementation: PRS Model
### Design Considerations:
- Database schema for polygenic risk scores
- Population-specific score adjustments
- Integration with existing variant annotations
- Risk weight calculation methodology
- Performance for large variant sets

### Key Files to Reference:
- `geneknow_pipeline/nodes/cadd_scoring.py` - Pattern for new model
- `geneknow_pipeline/scripts/fetch_cadd.sh` - Database download pattern
- `geneknow_pipeline/state.py` - Add prs_stats, prs_enriched_variants
- `geneknow_pipeline/graph.py` - Insert after CADD scoring

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for PRS calculations
- Integration tests with pipeline
- Performance tests with large variant sets
- Validation against known PRS databases

## Current Challenges
- Report writer needs updates for new architecture
- Remote database lookups not implemented
- Need production databases for all models

## Environment Notes
- Python virtual environment: `geneknow_pipeline/venv`
- Test data in: `test_data/` and `geneknow_pipeline/test_data/`
- CADD test database: `geneknow_pipeline/data/cadd_scores.db`

## Command Reference
```bash
# Activate environment
cd geneknow_pipeline && source venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
python test_cadd_integration.py
python test_cadd_minimal.py
python test_cadd_scoring.py

# Run pipeline with legacy risk
USE_LEGACY_RISK=true python test_pipeline.py

# Check implementation
grep -r "prs" nodes/
```
