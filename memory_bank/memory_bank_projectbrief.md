# GenePredict Project Brief

## Core Mission
Build a privacy-first, AI-powered genomic risk assessment desktop application that processes genetic data locally to provide personalized cancer risk predictions and actionable health insights.

## Primary Goals
1. **Privacy-First Genomic Analysis**: All genetic data processing occurs locally on user's machine - no cloud uploads, no external data sharing
2. **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Use machine learning models trained on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) reference data to predict cancer risk
3. **Clinical-Grade Accuracy**: Leverage world-class genomic datasets (1000 Genomes, ClinVar, TCGA) for reference-quality risk predictions
4. **Cross-Platform Desktop App**: Native performance on macOS, Windows, and Linux through Tauri framework
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Generate reports in English, Hindi, Spanish, and other languages

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Individuals with genetic testing results seeking personalized risk assessment
- **Secondary**: Healthcare providers and genetic counselors needing decision support tools
- **Tertiary**: Researchers studying population genomics and cancer risk factors

## Key Differentiators
- **100% Local Processing**: Zero data transmission ensures maximum privacy and GDPR/HIPAA compliance
- **TCGA Integration**: Access to 33+ cancer types with clinical outcomes data from 11,000+ patients
- **Multi-Modal AI**: Combines TensorFlow deep learning with Llama 3.1 for technical analysis + human-readable reports
- **Real Genomic Data**: No mock data - processes actual FASTQ/BAM/VCF files with clinical-grade variant calling

## Success Metrics
1. **Technical**: Process 100MB+ genomic files within 5-10 minutes locally
2. **Accuracy**: Risk predictions aligned with clinical literature (>85% concordance)
3. **Privacy**: Zero external network calls during genetic data processing
4. **Usability**: Non-technical users can generate actionable reports
5. **Compliance**: Full GDPR/HIPAA compliance through local-only architecture

## Business Model
Open-source foundation with premium features for healthcare providers and enterprise genomics labs.
