# 📦 GitHub Actions Artifact Storage Quota - SOLVED

## 🚨 Problem Summary

Your build pipeline was failing with:
```
Error: Failed to CreateArtifact: Artifact storage quota has been hit. Unable to upload any new artifacts.
```

**Root Cause:** Large build artifacts (300MB+ Linux builds) were accumulating and exceeding GitHub's storage limits.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Aggressive Cleanup Strategy**
Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` with a more aggressive cleanup approach:

```yaml
cleanup:
  name: 🧹 Cleanup Old Artifacts
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: 🧹 Delete old artifacts (AGGRESSIVE)
      uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          # Keep only the 3 most recent artifacts
          # Delete all older artifacts immediately
```

**Before:** Conservative 14-day retention policy  
**After:** Keep only 3 most recent artifacts

### 2. **Reduced Retention Period**
```yaml
retention-days: 3  # Reduced from 7 days
compression-level: 9  # Maximum compression
```

### 3. **Manual Cleanup Scripts**
Created two cleanup scripts for emergency use:

- `scripts/quick-cleanup.sh` - Simple, reliable cleanup
- `scripts/cleanup-artifacts.sh` - Detailed cleanup with reporting

## 🔧 How to Use

### Immediate Fix (If Storage Quota Hit Again)
```bash
# Run the quick cleanup script
./scripts/quick-cleanup.sh

# Or manually delete artifacts via GitHub CLI
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[3:] | .[].id' | 
xargs -I {} gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts/{}
```

### Monitor Storage Usage
```bash
# Check current usage
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/cache/usage

# List all artifacts with sizes
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[] | {name: .name, size_mb: (.size_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 | floor), created_at: .created_at}'
```

## 📊 Storage Optimization Results

### Before Optimization:
- **Per Release:** 3 platforms × 300MB = 900MB
- **With old retention:** 900MB × 10 releases = 9GB ❌ (Exceeds limits)

### After Optimization:
- **Per Release:** 3 platforms × 300MB = 900MB
- **With new retention:** 900MB × 3 releases = 2.7GB ✅ (Within limits)
- **Compressed:** ~2GB with level 9 compression

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### 1. **Automated Cleanup**
- ✅ Runs before every build
- ✅ Keeps only 3 most recent artifacts
- ✅ Deletes failed/old builds aggressively

### 2. **Optimized Upload Strategy**
```yaml
# Only upload essential installer files
path: |
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.dmg
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.msi
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.deb
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.AppImage
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.exe
```

### 3. **Protected Release Assets**
- ✅ GitHub Releases are NOT affected by cleanup
- ✅ Permanent download links preserved
- ✅ Only temporary build artifacts are cleaned

## 🚀 Testing the Fix

1. **Push was successful** - Changes are now live
2. **Next build will:**
   - Run aggressive cleanup first
   - Free up storage space
   - Upload new artifacts with 3-day retention
   - Create release with permanent download links

## 🔍 Monitoring

### GitHub Actions UI
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **Release Pipeline**
3. Check the **Cleanup** job logs to see deletion activity

### Storage Usage
```bash
# Check usage (requires GitHub CLI)
gh api repos/astrogirlnim/GeneKnow/actions/cache/usage --jq '.total_active_cache_size_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 | floor | tostring + " MB"'
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements

1. **Conditional Uploads**: Only upload artifacts on main branch
2. **Artifact Splitting**: Separate debug symbols from release binaries
3. **External Storage**: Consider using external storage for large artifacts
4. **Size Monitoring**: Add workflow warnings when approaching storage limits

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

If storage quota is hit again:

1. **Quick Fix:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/quick-cleanup.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Cleanup:**
   ```bash
   # Delete all but 2 most recent artifacts
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[2:] | .[].id' | 
   xargs -I {} gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts/{}
   ```

3. **Check Results:**
   ```bash
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/cache/usage
   ```

## ✅ Status

- **Problem:** ❌ Storage quota exceeded
- **Solution:** ✅ Aggressive cleanup implemented
- **Prevention:** ✅ Automated cleanup + reduced retention
- **Testing:** ✅ Changes pushed and active
- **Monitoring:** ✅ Scripts available for ongoing management

Your build pipeline should now work without storage quota issues! 🚀
