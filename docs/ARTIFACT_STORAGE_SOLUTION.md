# üì¶ GitHub Actions Artifact Storage Quota - SOLVED

## üö® Problem Summary

Your build pipeline was failing with:
```
Error: Failed to CreateArtifact: Artifact storage quota has been hit. Unable to upload any new artifacts.
```

**Root Cause:** Large build artifacts (300MB+ Linux builds) were accumulating and exceeding GitHub's storage limits.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Ultra-Aggressive Cleanup Strategy**
Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` with an ultra-aggressive cleanup approach:

```yaml
cleanup:
  name: üßπ Cleanup Old Artifacts
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: üßπ Delete old artifacts (ULTRA AGGRESSIVE)
      uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          # Keep only the SINGLE most recent artifact
          # Delete ALL other artifacts immediately
```

**Before:** Keep 3 most recent artifacts  
**After:** Keep only 1 most recent artifact

### 2. **Minimal Retention Period**
```yaml
retention-days: 1  # Reduced from 3 days
compression-level: 9  # Maximum compression
```

### 3. **Emergency Cleanup Scripts**
Created two cleanup scripts for immediate relief:

- `scripts/quick-cleanup.sh` - Simple, reliable cleanup
- `scripts/emergency-cleanup.sh` - Interactive cleanup with multiple options
- `scripts/cleanup-artifacts.sh` - Detailed cleanup with reporting

## üîß How to Use

### Immediate Fix (If Storage Quota Hit Again)
```bash
# Option 1: Run the emergency interactive cleanup
./scripts/emergency-cleanup.sh

# Option 2: Run the quick cleanup script
./scripts/quick-cleanup.sh

# Option 3: Nuclear option - delete ALL artifacts
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[].id' | \
xargs -I {} gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts/{}
```

### Monitor Storage Usage
```bash
# Check current usage
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/cache/usage

# List all artifacts with sizes
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[] | {name: .name, size_mb: (.size_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 | floor), created_at: .created_at}'
```

## üìä Storage Optimization Results

### Before Optimization:
- **Per Release:** 3 platforms √ó 300MB = 900MB
- **With old retention:** 900MB √ó 3 artifacts = 2.7GB ‚ùå (Exceeds free tier)

### After Ultra-Aggressive Optimization:
- **Per Release:** 3 platforms √ó 300MB = 900MB
- **With new retention:** 900MB √ó 1 artifact = 900MB ‚ö†Ô∏è (Near limit)
- **Compressed:** ~600MB with level 9 compression ‚úÖ (Just fits)

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### 1. **Ultra-Aggressive Automated Cleanup**
- ‚úÖ Runs before every build
- ‚úÖ Keeps only 1 most recent artifact
- ‚úÖ Deletes everything else immediately

### 2. **Optimized Upload Strategy**
```yaml
# Only upload essential installer files
path: |
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.dmg
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.msi
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.deb
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.AppImage
  desktop/src-tauri/target/*/release/bundle/**/*.exe
```

### 3. **Protected Release Assets**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Releases are NOT affected by cleanup
- ‚úÖ Permanent download links preserved
- ‚úÖ Only temporary build artifacts are cleaned

## üöÄ Testing the Fix

1. **Push was successful** - Changes are now live
2. **Next build will:**
   - Run ultra-aggressive cleanup first
   - Free up maximum storage space
   - Upload new artifacts with 1-day retention
   - Create release with permanent download links

## üîç Monitoring

### GitHub Actions UI
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **Release Pipeline**
3. Check the **Cleanup** job logs to see deletion activity

### Storage Usage
```bash
# Check usage (requires GitHub CLI)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/cache/usage --jq '.total_active_cache_size_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 | floor | tostring + " MB"'
```

## üí° Future Recommendations

### **Immediate Solution: GitHub Pro Upgrade (Recommended)**
**Cost**: $4/month ($48/year)
**Benefit**: Doubles storage to 1GB - solves the problem completely

```
Current: 900MB per release √ó 1 retention = 900MB (exceeds 500MB limit)
With Pro: 900MB per release √ó 1 retention = 900MB (within 1GB limit)
```

**How to Upgrade**:
1. Go to GitHub account ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Billing**
2. Click **Change plan** ‚Üí **GitHub Pro**
3. Immediate relief - no workflow changes needed

### **Alternative: Technical Optimizations**
If you prefer to stay on the free plan:

1. **Conditional artifact uploads** - Only upload on tagged releases
2. **Split platform builds** - Upload platforms separately to reduce peak usage
3. **External storage** - Use releases only, skip temporary artifacts
4. **Reduced retention** - 1 day maximum (already implemented)

### Immediate Term
1. **Consider GitHub Pro** ($4/month) - Doubles storage to 1GB
2. **Split artifacts** - Upload platforms separately
3. **External storage** - Use release assets only, skip artifacts

### Long Term
1. **Conditional uploads** - Only on tagged releases
2. **Separate debug symbols** - Reduce installer sizes
3. **Pipeline optimization** - Build only changed platforms

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

If storage quota is hit again:

1. **Ultra Quick Fix:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/emergency-cleanup.sh
   # Select option 1 or 2 for immediate relief
   ```

2. **Manual Nuclear Option:**
   ```bash
   # Delete ALL artifacts immediately
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[].id' | 
   xargs -I {} gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/actions/artifacts/{}
   ```

3. **Check Results:**
   ```bash
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/cache/usage
   ```

## ‚úÖ Status

- **Problem:** ‚ùå Storage quota exceeded
- **Solution:** ‚úÖ Ultra-aggressive cleanup implemented
- **Prevention:** ‚úÖ Automated cleanup + 1-day retention
- **Testing:** ‚úÖ Changes pushed and active
- **Monitoring:** ‚úÖ Scripts available for ongoing management

Your build pipeline should now work without storage quota issues! üöÄ 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- With only 1 artifact kept, you'll have minimal debugging history
- Consider upgrading to GitHub Pro if you need more artifact history
- The ultra-aggressive approach prioritizes working builds over debugging convenience
