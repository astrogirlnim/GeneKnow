# GenePredict â€“ Phase 1 Foundation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan details the foundational setup for GenePredict, ensuring a robust, modular, and future-proof codebase. It is designed for easy onboarding and collaboration among multiple developers. All steps reference requirements from:
- `documentation/GenePredict_BrainLift/GenePredict_TechStack_and_TeamPlan.md`
- `documentation/GenePredict_BrainLift/user-flow.md`
- `documentation/GenePredict_BrainLift/user-workflows.md`
- `documentation/GenePredict_BrainLift/GenePredict_PRD_V1.md`
- `PRD_V2.md`
- `documentation/Parallel-Genomic-Plan.md` (for plan structure)

---

## 1. Project Scaffolding & Tooling
- [ ] Initialize monorepo: `frontend/` (React+Tailwind), `backend/` (Rust+Python), `docs/`
- [ ] Set up Tauri in project root for desktop orchestration
- [ ] Bootstrap React app with Vite + Tailwind in `frontend/`
- [ ] Scaffold Rust backend in `backend/` with plugin system for Python interop
- [ ] Add Python subfolder in `backend/` for ML scripts/workflows
- [ ] Add Docker Compose for frontend, backend, and ML services
- [ ] Configure environment variable management for local paths/secrets

## 2. Core Libraries & Datasets
- [ ] Add TensorFlow and PySyft to Python environment
- [ ] Set up HuggingFace cache for Llama 3.1 weights (local only)
- [ ] Download 1000 Genomes & ClinVar reference data (document local storage)
- [ ] Document all data paths in `.env` or config files

## 3. CI/CD & Quality Baseline
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for backend (Rust/Python) and frontend (React) tests
- [ ] Add ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and React Testing Library to frontend
- [ ] Add Black, isort, and pytest to Python backend
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for all major languages
- [ ] Integrate Codecov for test coverage

## 4. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Add GDPR/HIPAA compliance checklist to repo
- [ ] Lock Docker network to local-only
- [ ] Enable at-rest encryption for temp genomic files (document approach)
- [ ] Add OSS license and CONTRIBUTING guidelines

## 5. Plugin Scaffolding for File Parsing & ML Execution
- [ ] Define Rust trait/interface for plugins (file parsing, ML execution)
- [ ] Implement initial plugin for Python ML invocation from Rust
- [ ] Scaffold file parsing plugin (FASTQ/BAM) with logging and error handling
- [ ] Add logging at every step (Rust, Python, React) for transparency

## 6. Developer Onboarding & Documentation
- [ ] Write onboarding guide in `docs/` for local setup, environment, and dev workflow
- [ ] Document project structure, plugin system, and data flow
- [ ] Add architecture diagram (Mermaid or similar) to `docs/`

## 7. Testing & Verification
- [ ] Add CLI scripts for local dev/test (manual verification, no test files)
- [ ] Add logging to all major flows for easy debugging
- [ ] Test:
    - Tauri launches and loads React UI
    - Rust backend can call Python ML script and return result
    - File parsing plugin loads and logs file metadata

## Summary Checklist
- [ ] Monorepo structure: `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/`
- [ ] Tauri setup in root
- [ ] React+Tailwind in `frontend/`
- [ ] Rust+Python plugin system in `backend/`
- [ ] Docker Compose for all services
- [ ] Environment variable/config management
- [ ] Core ML/data libraries installed
- [ ] GitHub Actions, linting, pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Security/compliance docs and settings
- [ ] Plugin scaffolding for file parsing/ML
- [ ] Logging everywhere
- [ ] Onboarding docs and architecture diagram
- [ ] Manual CLI test scripts

**All steps must be fully functional, production-ready, and thoroughly logged. No mock data or placeholder code.**
