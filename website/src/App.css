   GenePredict - App.css
   ========================================================================== */

/* 
   NOTE: The main CSS framework for GenePredict has been moved to index.css
   This file can be used for component-specific styles if needed in the future.
   
   The comprehensive CSS framework includes:
   - CSS variables and design tokens
   - Component styles (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
   - Utility classes
   - Responsive design
   - Dark mode support
   - Accessibility features
   - Custom animations
   
   All styles are now centralized in index.css and automatically loaded
   by main.tsx on application startup.

/* Component-specific styles can be added here if needed */
