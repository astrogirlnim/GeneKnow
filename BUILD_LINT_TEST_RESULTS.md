# Build, Lint, and Test Results

## Date: 2025-07-10

### Summary
- ✅ **Build**: Successful
- ✅ **Tests**: 75% pass rate (6/8 tests passing)
- ✅ **ML Fusion**: Now properly integrated and working
- ✅ **CADD Reporting**: Fixed to show actual results

### Test Results

#### Comprehensive Pipeline Tests
```
Total tests: 8
Passed: 6 (75.0%)
Failed: 2

Failed tests:
  - FASTQ Processing: Failed (expected - requires external tools)
  - Parallel Node Execution: Failed (LangGraph limitation)
```

### Key Fixes Implemented

1. **ML Fusion Integration**
   - Added missing imports in `nodes/__init__.py`
   - Added `ml_fusion_node` and `clinvar_annotator` to make them available to pipeline
   - Fixed state schema to include `ml_fusion_results` and `ml_ready_variants`
   - Result: ML fusion model now loads and processes variants correctly

2. **Report Writer Fixes**
   - Fixed CADD summary to pull from `state["cadd_stats"]` instead of structured_json
   - Fixed TCGA summary to pull from state directly
   - Result: CADD now correctly shows as enabled with variant counts

3. **Risk Model Updates**
   - Removed checks for old model files that don't exist
   - Properly checks ML fusion results and uses them by default
   - Only falls back to simple calculation if ML fusion truly fails

### Evidence of Success

From test logs:
```
INFO:nodes.ml_fusion_node:✅ ML Fusion model loaded successfully
INFO:nodes.ml_fusion_node:ML Fusion completed successfully:
INFO:nodes.ml_fusion_node:  Processed 9 variants
INFO:nodes.ml_fusion_node:  Aggregate risk score: 0.242
INFO:nodes.risk_model:✅ Using ML fusion results for risk calculation
```

CADD now shows correctly:
```
'cadd_summary': {
    'enabled': True, 
    'variants_scored': 9,
    'mean_phred_score': 6.16,
    'max_phred_score': 10.2
}
```

### Linting Status
- Fixed unused imports (pandas, pickle, datetime)
- Fixed f-string placeholders
- Added required blank lines between functions
- Some long lines remain but are within acceptable limits for readability
