# GeneKnow Desktop App - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The GeneKnow desktop application is now fully integrated with the LangGraph genomic processing backend. Users can upload genomic files, see real-time processing progress, and view comprehensive analysis results.

## How File Upload Works

1. **File Selection**
   - Users click the upload area or drag & drop files
   - Standard HTML file input is used (works across all platforms)
   - Supported formats: FASTQ, VCF, BAM, MAF, GZ

2. **File Handling**
   - The file content is read in the browser using FileReader API
   - Content is sent to the Rust backend via `save_temp_file` command
   - File is saved to system temp directory: `/tmp/geneknow_temp/`
   - Returns the temporary file path for processing

3. **Processing**
   - The `process_genomic_file` command sends the file path to Python API
   - Python API server runs the LangGraph pipeline
   - Progress updates are polled every second
   - Results are returned when processing completes

## Key Components

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- `UploadPage.tsx` - File selection and upload UI
- `DashboardPage.tsx` - Results display with real pipeline data
- `geneknowTauri.ts` - Tauri command integration

### Backend (Rust)
- `save_temp_file` - Saves uploaded files temporarily
- `process_genomic_file` - Initiates genomic processing
- `get_job_status` - Returns processing progress
- `get_job_results` - Returns analysis results

### Python API
- `enhanced_api_server.py` - FastAPI server
- LangGraph pipeline for genomic analysis
- Auto-starts when desktop app launches

## Data Flow

```
User selects file → File read in browser → Content sent to Rust
    ↓
Rust saves temp file → Returns file path
    ↓
Frontend calls process_genomic_file → Rust calls Python API
    ↓
Python processes with LangGraph → Progress updates via polling
    ↓
Results returned → Dashboard displays analysis
```

## File Storage

- Temporary files are saved to: `/tmp/geneknow_temp/`
- Files are preserved during processing
- Consider implementing cleanup after processing completes

## Current Limitations

1. Large files may cause memory issues (entire file is read into memory)
2. No direct file path access (security limitation of web file input)
3. Temporary files aren't automatically cleaned up

## Future Improvements

1. Implement streaming for large files
2. Add file cleanup after processing
3. Add support for batch processing
4. Implement proper error recovery
5. Add file validation before processing

## Testing

Run the app with:
```bash
cd desktop/ui
pnpm tauri-dev
```

The app will:
- Start the frontend dev server
- Launch the Tauri desktop app  
- Auto-start the Python API server
- Enable file uploads and processing
