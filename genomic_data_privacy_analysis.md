# Genomic Data Privacy Analysis: 1000 Genomes & gnomAD

## Executive Summary

Our system contains **aggregated, de-identified genomic data** from two major sources:
1. **1000 Genomes Project** (Phase 3) - Population variant frequencies
2. **gnomAD** (v2.1.1 & v3.1.2) - Large-scale variant frequency database
3. **TCGA** (Cancer Genome Atlas) - Cancer-specific variant frequencies

**Key Privacy Finding**: The data stored is **aggregated frequency information only** - no individual genomes or identifiable genetic profiles are stored. Fingerprinting from our database alone would be extremely difficult, but some privacy risks exist when combined with user-uploaded data.

```

### 3. TCGA Database (Local Storage)
**What we store locally:**
- **Database**: SQLite file (`tcga_variants.db`)
- **Size**: 24KB (83 total variants)
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE variants (
      cancer_type TEXT,          -- breast, colon, lung, prostate, blood
      chrom TEXT,                -- chr17, chr5, etc.
      pos INTEGER,               -- genomic position
      ref TEXT,                  -- reference allele
      alt TEXT,                  -- alternate allele
      gene TEXT,                 -- gene symbol (BRCA1, TP53, etc.)
      sample_count INTEGER,      -- number of patients with variant
      total_samples INTEGER,     -- total patients in cohort
      frequency REAL,            -- variant frequency (0.0-1.0)
      clinical_significance TEXT -- pathogenic, benign, etc.
  );
  ```

**Cancer cohort sizes:**
- Breast: 1,084 patients
- Colon: 461 patients
- Lung: 585 patients  
- Prostate: 498 patients
- Blood: 200 patients

**Sample data:**
```
breast|chr17|41223094|A|G|BRCA1|68|1084|0.063|Uncertain significance
colon|chr17|41223094|A|G|BRCA1|0|461|0.002|Likely benign
```

## Privacy Analysis

### What CAN'T Be Used for Fingerprinting

✅ **Aggregated frequencies only** - No individual genomes stored
✅ **De-identified data** - No patient identifiers in databases
✅ **Statistical summaries** - Only population-level statistics
✅ **Limited variant set** - Only 83 cancer-related variants stored locally
✅ **No raw genomic data** - No FASTQ, BAM, or complete VCF files stored

### Potential Privacy Risks

⚠️ **User-uploaded data processing**:
- System processes user's raw genomic files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF)
- Temporary files created during analysis
- Variant lists generated from user data

⚠️ **Variant combination analysis**:
- Rare variant combinations could be identifying
- Multiple gene variants together may reduce anonymity
- Cross-referencing with external databases possible

⚠️ **Population inference**:
- Ancestry information could be inferred from variant patterns
- Geographic origins may be identifiable from population frequencies

### Fingerprinting Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW to MODERATE**

**Cannot fingerprint from our database alone because:**
1. Only stores aggregated population frequencies
2. No individual genetic profiles
3. Limited to 83 cancer-related variants
4. No linkage to personal identifiers

**Potential fingerprinting vectors:**
1. **Uploaded file analysis**: User's raw genomic data contains full genetic profile
2. **Rare variant combinations**: Multiple rare variants together may be identifying
3. **Population stratification**: Ancestry-informative markers could reveal geographic origins
4. **Cross-database correlation**: Combining with external genomic databases

## Privacy Protections Implemented

### 1. Local-First Processing
- **Zero external transmission**: All analysis happens locally
- **No cloud storage**: No genomic data sent to external servers
- **Offline capability**: Works without internet connection

### 2. Data Minimization
- **Aggregated data only**: No individual genomes stored
- **Limited variant set**: Only cancer-relevant variants in local database
- **Temporary file cleanup**: Raw analysis files deleted after processing

### 3. Security Architecture
- **Tauri framework**: Sandboxed desktop application
- **Rust backend**: Memory-safe processing
- **Local SQLite**: No external database connections
- **No telemetry**: No usage data transmitted

### 4. Compliance Features
- **HIPAA compatible**: Local processing supports healthcare use
- **GDPR compliant**: No data transmission to third parties
- **Open source**: Transparent data handling

## Recommendations

### For Enhanced Privacy

1. **Implement differential privacy** for population frequency queries
2. **Add k-anonymity** checks for rare variant combinations
3. **Secure file deletion** for temporary genomic files
4. **Encrypted storage** for cached reference data
5. **Audit logging** for data access patterns

### For Users

1. **Understand data flow**: Know what data is processed locally
2. **Secure file storage**: Encrypt genomic files at rest
3. **Network isolation**: Run analysis offline when possible
4. **Regular cleanup**: Delete temporary analysis files

### For Developers

1. **Minimize data retention**: Delete temporary files immediately
2. **Audit dependencies**: Review all genomic databases accessed
3. **Implement privacy-by-design**: Consider privacy in all features
4. **Regular security reviews**: Audit code for privacy leaks

## Conclusion

Our system implements strong privacy protections through local-first processing and data minimization. While the aggregated genomic databases (1000 Genomes, gnomAD, TCGA) pose minimal fingerprinting risk individually, privacy considerations arise when processing user-uploaded genomic data.

The combination of rare variants, population stratification, and external database correlations could potentially reduce anonymity. However, our local-first architecture and security measures significantly mitigate these risks compared to cloud-based genomic analysis platforms.

**Overall Assessment**: Low to moderate privacy risk with strong protections in place. Suitable for clinical and research use with appropriate user consent and security practices.
