### Goal 1: Achieve "Sample-to-Insight" in Minutes, Not Days
(Capability 1, 2, 3)

Dramatically reduce the hands-on time required for analysis. For a clinician with a patient's variant file (`.vcf`), the app should automate the entire annotation and prioritization workflow, delivering a preliminary report of critical cancer-related gene variants in under 5 minutes. This directly tackles the turnaround time bottleneck.

### Goal 2: Empower Technicians and Researchers with a "Zero-Code" Interface
(Capability 2, 4 - 9)

Eliminate the need for bioinformatics expertise for primary analysis. The goal is to create an intuitive graphical user interface where a lab technician or biologist can confidently load data, apply standard cancer gene panel filters, and understand the results without writing a single line of code. This makes genomic testing truly accessible to the people at the front lines of research and care.

### Goal 3: Deliver a Zero-Cloud-Cost, Secure Analysis Platform
(Capability 8, 9)

Make genomic analysis more cost-effective and secure by completely removing the reliance on expensive cloud computing and storage. All processing will be done locally on the user's desktop, eliminating recurring fees and mitigating HIPAA-related data privacy risks. The only "cost" will be the one-time download of open-source databases, making the tool fundamentally cheaper than cloud-based alternatives.
