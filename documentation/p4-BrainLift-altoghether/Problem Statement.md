- **High Financial Barrier to Entry:** The combined cost of sequencing and expert analysis is prohibitive for many labs. While sequencing costs have fallen, the total price for clinical-grade analysis remains a significant hurdle, slowing down research and clinical adoption.
    
    - **Metric:** full cost including sample prep, quality control, data storage, and expert bioinformatic interpretation for a clinical report can still range from **$1,000 to over $5,000 per genome**.
        
    - **Resource:** Discussions on sequencing costs and the associated labor/expertise costs highlight this gap (e.g., [3billion.io](https://3billion.io/blog/price-of-whole-genome-sequencing-2024whole-genome-sequencing-cost-2023)).
        
- **Critical Delays in Turnaround Time:** In a clinical setting, especially for aggressive cancers, treatment decisions are time-sensitive. The current multi-step process from sample shipment to final report delivery is dangerously slow.
    
    - **Metric:** The median turnaround time for next-generation sequencing (NGS) reports is often **9 to 14 days**, with complex cases taking even longer. This delay can postpone critical therapeutic decisions.
        
    - **Resource:** Clinical analyses consistently report this 1-2 week window as a standard, yet challenging, timeframe ([JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7529535/)).
        
- **Massive Data Burden & Privacy Risks:** Genomic datasets are enormous, making them difficult to transfer, store, and process. Uploading sensitive patient data to third-party cloud services creates significant logistical and security challenges. (US only)
    
    - **Metric:** A single human whole-genome sequence (`.fastq` and `.bam` files) can easily exceed **180 GB**. Transferring and storing data for even a small cohort of patients requires terabytes of space and can take hours or days on standard networks.
        
    - **Resource:** Breakdowns of genomic file sizes illustrate this data burden, emphasizing the preference for local processing when possible ([3billion.io Blog on Big Data](https://3billion.io/blog/big-data-among-big-data-genome-data)).
        
- **The Bioinformatics Expertise Gap:** There are not enough trained bioinformaticians to analyze the flood of genomic data being generated. This personnel bottleneck means that even when data is available, the expertise to interpret it is often lacking, especially in smaller hospitals and research labs.
    
    - **Metric:** The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment for computer and information research scientists (including bioinformaticians) will grow by **26% by 2033**, much faster than the average for all occupations, indicating a high demand that outstrips the current supply.
        
    - **Resource:** Industry analyses confirm this trend, labeling bioinformatics as a top in-demand role where the need for talent is growing faster than it can be filled ([BioSpace](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/bioinformatics-roles-in-increasing-demand-critical-to-industry-personalized-medicine)).
