# Geneknow: A Privacy-First Local Genomic Risk Assessment Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

Geneknow is an open-source desktop application designed for privacy-preserving genomic risk assessment, enabling clinicians and researchers to analyze genetic data entirely on local hardware without external data transmission. Built on a Tauri-based architecture with React frontend, Rust integration, and Python ML backend, it processes formats such as FASTQ, BAM, and VCF to generate interpretable risk reports for specific cancers including blood and bone, breast, colon, lung, and prostate, with potential for future expansion.

Key differentiators include its HIPAA-friendly design, cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, macOS Intel), and use of LangGraph for orchestrating accurate, reproducible genomic predictions. By leveraging aggregate statistics databases without storing actual patient data or FASTQs, Geneknow ensures data privacy while providing clinically relevant insights.

This whitepaper outlines Geneknow's architecture, scientific foundation, and value in clinical and research settings.

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

Genomic data analysis has revolutionized personalized medicine, but traditional cloud-based tools raise significant privacy concerns, with data breaches affecting millions [1]. Regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR demand stringent data protection, yet many solutions require internet connectivity and external servers, limiting accessibility in low-resource or secure environments [2].

Geneknow addresses these challenges with a fully local, offline-capable platform that performs end-to-end genomic risk assessment on the user's device. Motivated by the need for accessible, compliant tools, Geneknow empowers users to analyze genetic variants for cancer risk without compromising privacy.

## 3. System Overview

Geneknow employs a hybrid architecture combining Tauri's lightweight Rust core for system integration, a React-based frontend for intuitive user interaction, and a Python backend for ML-driven analysis. The system uses LangGraph to manage complex workflows, ensuring accurate predictions through modular, traceable node-based processing [3].

- **Input Handling:** Supports FASTQ, BAM, VCF via secure, local file uploads.
- **Processing Pipeline:** LangGraph-orchestrated nodes for variant calling, annotation, and risk scoring.
- **Output:** Comprehensive reports with visualizations, exportable in PDF/JSON formats.
- **Privacy Architecture:** All data remains on-device; no network calls post-installation.

Cross-platform compatibility is achieved through Tauri's bundling, with Rust handling low-level operations for efficiency.

## 4. Core Technologies & Architecture

### 4.1 LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

Geneknow's backend leverages LangGraph for deterministic workflow management, ensuring reproducibility in genomic predictions. Nodes include file input, MAF parsing, mutation classification, and report generation, connected in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for efficient parallel execution [4].

### 4.2 Machine Learning Pipeline

The ML pipeline integrates ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on aggregate data from TCGA and COSMIC, avoiding patient-specific information [5]. SHAP values provide interpretability, explaining model decisions for clinical trust [6].

### 4.3 Static Models and Metrics

Geneknow employs several static models to compute risk metrics, each producing specific outputs for comprehensive analysis [7]:

- **Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** Aggregates common variant effects into a standardized score (mean 0, SD 1), indicating relative population risk [8].
- **ClinVar Annotation:** Classifies variants as Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, etc., with evidence levels and clinical significance scores.
- **CADD Scoring:** Provides deleteriousness scores (PHRED-scaled, higher indicates more deleterious) for SNVs and indels [9].
- **TCGA Mapper:** Maps variants to TCGA cohorts, computing frequency-based risk multipliers.
- **Pathway Burden Analysis:** Calculates pathway disruption scores (0-100%) for cancer-related pathways, with overall burden aggregation.

These metrics fuse into a unified risk profile, validated against real datasets.

### 4.4 Plugin System

An emerging plugin system allows extensibility, with initial support for custom ML nodes (in development).

### 4.5 Data Management

Geneknow uses SQLite databases containing aggregate statistics from public sources (e.g., gnomAD, ClinVar), ensuring no raw patient data is stored [10].

## 5. Privacy & Security Design

Geneknow's HIPAA-friendly architecture processes all data locally, eliminating transmission risks. Features include encrypted temporary storage and automatic data cleanup post-analysis. While not formally certified, the design aligns with HIPAA technical safeguards (e.g., access controls, audit logs) [11].

## 6. User Interface and Experience

Geneknow provides an intuitive, modern UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, emphasizing usability for clinical workflows.

### 6.1 Dashboard

The dashboard serves as the central hub for job management and quick insights, featuring:

- **Job List Section:** Displays running and completed analyses with status indicators, progress bars, and metadata (e.g., input type, start time).
- **Quick Stats Overview:** Summarizes key metrics like overall risk score, number of variants detected, and high-level cancer associations.
- **Recent Activity Feed:** Logs recent jobs with clickable previews for detailed views.
- **Visualization Widgets:** Interactive charts showing risk distribution, variant types, and pathway burdens.
- **Export Options:** Buttons to export dashboard summaries as PDF or CSV, including embedded graphs.

### 6.2 Clinical View (In-Depth Analysis Tab)

The Clinical View provides detailed, tabbed analysis for deep dives:

- **Overview Tab:** High-level summary with fused risk score, cancer type probabilities, and patient metadata.
- **Variants Tab:** Detailed table of detected variants with filters, sorting, and columns for gene, impact, ClinVar status, CADD score.
- **Pathway Analysis Tab:** Visualizations of disrupted pathways (e.g., bar charts for burden scores), gene-pathway mappings, and impact explanations.
- **Survival Analysis Tab:** Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios based on TCGA-matched data.
- **Metrics Tab:** Comprehensive breakdown of all static model outputs, with SHAP force plots for ML explanations.
- **Report Generation:** Customizable export to PDF with selectable sections, graphs, and raw metrics.

Exports support high-resolution PNG/ SVG for visualizations and JSON for raw data, enabling integration with external tools.

## 7. Scientific Validation & Performance

Models were trained on TCGA data (n=10,000+ samples), achieving AUC >0.85 for cancer risk prediction [12]. Local execution ensures consistency across hardware, with optimizations for multi-core processing.

## 8. Applications & Case Studies

In clinical settings, Geneknow aids risk stratification for at-risk patients. Research applications include batch processing for cohort studies, all offline.

## 9. Future Directions

Expansion to additional cancer types, full plugin ecosystem, and mobile support.

## 10. Conclusion

Geneknow democratizes genomic analysis with privacy at its core, bridging accessibility and scientific rigor.
