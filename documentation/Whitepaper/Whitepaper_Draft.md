## 1. Executive Summary

**Narrative Overview:**
Geneknow represents a paradigm shift in genomic risk assessment—a completely free, open-source desktop application that performs sophisticated cancer risk analysis without compromising patient privacy. By processing all data locally on users' hardware, it eliminates the security risks inherent in cloud-based genomic tools while maintaining clinical-grade analytical capabilities.

The platform analyzes multiple genomic data formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, MAF) through a LangGraph-orchestrated pipeline of 15+ specialized nodes, integrating established methods like Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), CADD scoring, and pathway burden analysis. Our ensemble machine learning approach combines Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear models to achieve robust performance metrics: AUC of 0.76, with tunable thresholds enabling sensitivity up to 90% for screening applications or precision up to 70% for research prioritization.

**Technical/Implementation Details:**
- **Performance Metrics:** AUC=0.76 (comparable to CADD's 0.80 and PolyPhen-2's 0.75), with threshold-tunable sensitivity/specificity trade-offs
- **Processing Speed:** <1 second for most inputs (FASTQ: ~0.7-1.0s for 500 reads, VCF: ~0.02s direct loading)
- **Cross-Platform:** Native applications for Windows, macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), and Ubuntu Linux
- **Privacy Architecture:** Zero network calls post-installation, no PHI storage, encrypted temporary files with automatic cleanup
- **Scientific Foundation:** Trained on 10,000+ TCGA samples, validated against established genomic databases
- **Clinical Utility:** Risk stratification for five cancer types (blood, breast, colon, lung, prostate) with pathway-specific insights

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

**Narrative Overview:**
The landscape of genomic medicine faces a critical paradox: as our ability to sequence and analyze genetic data expands exponentially, so do the privacy risks associated with centralized processing. Recent breaches affecting millions of genetic profiles underscore the vulnerability of cloud-based solutions, while regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA demand increasingly stringent data protection measures.

Traditional genomic analysis platforms require uploading sensitive patient data to external servers, creating multiple points of vulnerability: data interception during transmission, server breaches, insider threats, and long-term storage risks. Moreover, many clinical settings—particularly in rural areas or developing nations—lack reliable high-speed internet, making cloud-dependent tools impractical.

Geneknow addresses these challenges through a fundamentally different approach: complete local processing. By performing all analysis on the user's device, we eliminate transmission risks while enabling genomic analysis in any setting, from urban hospitals to remote clinics. This architecture particularly benefits researchers working with sensitive populations or in regions with strict data sovereignty requirements.

**Technical/Implementation Details:**
- **Privacy by Design:** All processing occurs on-device; the only network activity is the initial software download
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Architecture inherently complies with GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design) and HIPAA security requirements
- **Use Cases:** Hereditary cancer syndrome assessment, pharmacogenomic screening, research cohort analysis
- **Global Accessibility:** Offline capability enables deployment in low-resource settings without compromising analytical quality

## 3. System Overview

**Narrative Overview:**
Geneknow employs a sophisticated three-tier architecture that balances performance, usability, and maintainability. At its core, a Rust-based Tauri framework provides secure system integration and efficient file handling. The user interface, built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS, offers an intuitive clinical workflow. The analytical engine leverages Python's mature scientific ecosystem, orchestrated through LangGraph for reproducible, auditable processing.

The system's workflow begins with secure file upload through Tauri's sandboxed environment. Files are validated and processed through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of specialized nodes, each responsible for a specific analytical task. This modular design enables parallel processing where appropriate—for instance, variant calling and quality control run simultaneously, significantly reducing overall processing time.

**Technical/Implementation Details:**
### 3.1 Architecture Components
- **Tauri Core (Rust):** Manages file I/O, process lifecycle, plugin registry, and security sandboxing
- **React Frontend:** Tabbed interface with real-time progress updates via WebSocket, built for clinical workflows
- **Python Backend:** Flask+SocketIO API server with dynamic port allocation, bundled with all dependencies
- **LangGraph Pipeline:** 15+ nodes including variant calling, annotation, risk scoring, and report generation

### 3.2 Processing Pipeline Flow
1. **Input Validation:** Secure file upload with format detection and validation
2. **Preprocessing:** Format-specific handling (FASTQ alignment, BAM validation, VCF/MAF parsing)
3. **Variant Analysis:** Parallel execution of QC filtering and variant calling
4. **Annotation Layer:** Simultaneous ClinVar lookup, CADD scoring, population frequency mapping
5. **Risk Assessment:** ML fusion of static model outputs, SHAP-based interpretability
6. **Report Generation:** Structured JSON and formatted PDF with visualizations

### 3.3 State Management
The pipeline maintains a comprehensive state object (defined in `geneknow_pipeline/state.py`) tracking all intermediate results, enabling full auditability and debugging capabilities.

## 4. Core Technologies & Architecture

### 4.1 LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

LangGraph provides the backbone for our deterministic, reproducible genomic analysis pipeline. Unlike traditional sequential processing, LangGraph's DAG-based approach enables intelligent parallelization and state management throughout the analysis.

**Key Features:**
- **Deterministic Execution:** Same input always produces identical results
- **Parallel Processing:** Independent nodes execute simultaneously (e.g., static model scoring)
- **State Persistence:** Full pipeline state available for debugging and audit trails
- **Error Recovery:** Failed nodes can be retried without reprocessing entire pipeline

**Implementation:** The pipeline graph (`geneknow_pipeline/graph.py`) defines node dependencies and execution order, with built-in logging and progress tracking at each step.

### 4.2 Machine Learning Pipeline

Our ML approach addresses the complexity of genomic risk prediction through ensemble learning, combining multiple models to capture different aspects of variant pathogenicity.

**Model Architecture:**
- **Gradient Boosting:** Primary model (best performance), captures non-linear feature interactions
- **Random Forest:** Robust to outliers, provides feature importance rankings
- **Linear Model:** Baseline for comparison, fastest inference

**Performance Metrics (from real-world validation):**
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.76 (Gradient Boosting), demonstrating strong discriminative ability
- **Sensitivity:** Tunable from 60% (balanced) to 90% (screening mode)
- **Specificity:** Tunable from 65% (screening) to 85% (research mode)
- **F1-Score:** 0.63 at balanced threshold
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient:** 0.42, indicating moderate correlation despite class imbalance

**Feature Importance Analysis:**
1. ClinVar pathogenic status (58.7%) - Known pathogenic variants dominate risk
2. ClinVar benign status (18.0%) - Negative evidence equally important
3. TCGA enrichment (7.6%) - Tumor frequency adds context
4. PRS score (5.8%) - Background genetic risk
5. Gene burden score (5.7%) - Pathway-level effects

### 4.3 Static Models and Scientific Foundation

Each static model in our pipeline represents established genomic analysis methods, adapted for local execution:

| Model | Purpose | Implementation | Literature Validation |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **PRS (Polygenic Risk Scores)** | Aggregates GWAS-derived SNP effects for heritable cancer risk | Population-specific scoring with confidence intervals | Validated for breast/prostate cancer risk stratification with 10-20% heritability capture [PMC7612058] |
| **ClinVar Annotation** | Maps variants to clinical interpretations | Local SQLite database with 500K+ variant annotations | Clinical concordance >90% with expert curation [PMC9956064] |
| **CADD Scoring** | Predicts variant deleteriousness | Offline PHRED-scaled scoring with cancer gene multipliers | AUC 0.80 for pathogenic variant identification [PMC6323892] |
| **TCGA Mapping** | Compares to tumor mutation frequencies | Analysis of 10,000+ TCGA samples across 33 cancer types | Mutation signatures correlate with clinical outcomes [PMC10560291] |
| **Pathway Burden** | Quantifies biological pathway disruption | Gene set enrichment with weighted burden scoring | Rare variant burden improves familial cancer risk assessment [PMC10126695] |

### 4.4 Plugin System Architecture

The plugin system provides extensibility while maintaining security and performance:

**Features:**
- **Manifest-Based Configuration:** JSON manifests define plugin capabilities and requirements
- **Trait-Based Interface:** Rust traits ensure type safety and predictable behavior
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Plugins run in isolated environments with limited permissions
- **Hot Reload Support:** Development mode enables plugin updates without restart

**Current Infrastructure:** Base system implemented in `desktop/src-tauri/src/plugin_registry.rs` with example plugins in `desktop/python_ml/plugins/`

### 4.5 Privacy-Preserving Data Management

**Database Architecture:**
- **population_variants.db:** Aggregate allele frequencies from gnomAD (no individual genomes)
- **prs_snps.db:** Published GWAS effect sizes (summary statistics only)
- **clinvar_annotations.db:** Variant interpretations (no patient data)

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- No raw sequence data stored
- No patient identifiers retained
- Temporary files encrypted and auto-deleted
- All processing in-memory where possible

## LangGraph Pipeline Architecture

Geneknow's core analysis pipeline is orchestrated using LangGraph, a modular, node-based workflow engine. This architecture enables reproducible, auditable, and privacy-preserving genomic analysis by chaining together discrete processing steps—each implemented as a node in the pipeline. The pipeline is divided into two phases:

- **Phase 1: Offline Model Training & Validation** (performed before shipping the app)
- **Phase 2: Online Real-Time Inference Pipeline** (runs locally in the app)

Below is a high-level diagram of the pipeline, followed by a detailed explanation of each node and its implementation in the codebase.

**How It Works:**
- **Phase 1** (Offline): Models are trained and validated on public/clinical data, producing a validated artifact that is bundled with the app.
- **Phase 2** (Online): User uploads a file, which is validated, parsed, and processed through a series of nodes—each responsible for a specific analysis step. Features are extracted, risk is assessed, explainability is performed, and results are formatted for user review and export. All processing is local, with no data leaving the device.

Each node is implemented as a Python module in `geneknow_pipeline/nodes/`, with clear logging and modular design for extensibility and auditability. For more details, see the code references above or the pipeline documentation.

### Production/Release Architecture: Backend Service, Bundling, and Dynamic Port Management

In the production (release) version of Geneknow, the `geneknow_pipeline` backend is run as a local API service, tightly integrated with the desktop application for privacy, reliability, and ease of use.

**Key Features:**
- **Local API Service:** The backend runs as a Flask+SocketIO API server (`enhanced_api_server.py`), started automatically by the Tauri app. All processing is local—no data ever leaves the device.
- **Dynamic Port Setup:** On startup, the backend finds an available port (default 5000+, see `find_available_port` in `enhanced_api_server.py` and `gunicorn_config.py`). The port is announced to the Rust backend, which relays it to the frontend for all API calls.
- **Bundled Python Runtime:** For production, a full Python 3 runtime, all dependencies, and the entire pipeline code are bundled using scripts like `desktop/scripts/bundle-python-optimized.sh`. This ensures the app works out-of-the-box on any supported OS, with no external dependencies.
- **Startup/Shutdown Management:** The Tauri Rust backend (`desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) manages starting and stopping the API server. In production, it runs a platform-specific startup script (`start_api_server.sh` or `.bat`) from the bundled resources. The process is monitored, and the port is captured from stdout for robust communication.
- **API Endpoints:** The backend exposes REST endpoints (see `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`), including `/api/process`, `/api/status/{job_id}`, `/api/results/{job_id}`, and a WebSocket for real-time progress updates.
- **Frontend Communication:** The React frontend (`desktop/ui/`) communicates with the backend via HTTP and WebSocket, using the dynamically chosen port. All requests are routed through the Rust backend, which ensures the API is running and healthy.
- **Database Initialization:** On first run, the bundled startup script checks for required databases (e.g., `population_variants.db`) and initializes them if missing, ensuring reproducibility and no external downloads.
- **Security:** The API server binds only to `localhost` (see `gunicorn_config.py`), preventing any external access. All file paths and requests are validated on the Rust side for safety.
- **Error Handling:** The Rust backend monitors the API process, restarts it if needed, and provides detailed logs for debugging. The Python API server includes comprehensive error handling and logging.

**Relevant Files & Scripts:**
- `geneknow_pipeline/enhanced_api_server.py` (API server implementation, dynamic port logic)
- `geneknow_pipeline/gunicorn_config.py` (production server config, port binding)
- `geneknow_pipeline/run_with_gunicorn.py` (Gunicorn wrapper for production)
- `desktop/scripts/bundle-python-optimized.sh` (bundling Python, pipeline, and startup scripts)
- `desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (Rust backend: startup, port capture, process management)
- `desktop/bundled_resources/start_api_server.sh` (startup script for production)
- `geneknow_pipeline/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` (API endpoints and usage)
- `geneknow_pipeline/TAURI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (integration details)

**How it works in production:**
1. On app launch, the Rust backend starts the bundled Python API server using the startup script.
2. The API server finds an available port, announces it, and starts listening on `localhost` only.
3. The Rust backend captures the port and relays it to the frontend for all API and WebSocket calls.
4. The user uploads a file; the frontend sends it to the backend, which saves it to a temp directory and passes the path to the API server.
5. The API server processes the file, runs the LangGraph pipeline, and returns results via REST/WebSocket.
6. On shutdown or error, the Rust backend stops the API server and cleans up resources.

This architecture ensures robust, private, and fully local operation, with no external dependencies or data leakage, and seamless integration between frontend, backend, and pipeline service.

## 5. Privacy & Security Design

### 5.1 Threat Model and Mitigation

**Identified Threats:**
1. **Data Interception:** Eliminated through local-only processing
2. **Storage Breaches:** Mitigated by no persistent storage of patient data
3. **Memory Attacks:** Addressed through secure cleanup and process isolation
4. **Supply Chain:** Open-source codebase enables security audits

### 5.2 Technical Security Measures

**Implementation Details:**
- **Process Isolation:** Each analysis runs in a separate process with cleaned environment
