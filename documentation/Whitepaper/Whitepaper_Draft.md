# Geneknow: A Privacy-First Local Genomic Risk Assessment Platform

> **Disclaimer:** Geneknow is a statistical tool for investigative and research purposes only. It does not provide medical or clinical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. All results are intended for informational use by qualified professionals. Users must not rely on Geneknow for clinical decision-making. 

## 1. Executive Summary

**Narrative Overview:**
Geneknow is a completely free and open-source desktop application designed for privacy-preserving genomic risk assessment, enabling clinicians and researchers to analyze genetic data entirely on local hardware without external data transmission. Built on a Tauri-based architecture with React frontend, Rust integration, and Python ML backend, it processes formats such as FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and MAF to generate interpretable risk reports for specific cancers including blood, breast, colon, lung, and prostate, with potential for future expansion.

Key differentiators include its HIPAA-friendly design (not formally HIPAA-compliant), cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, macOS Intel), and use of LangGraph for orchestrating accurate, reproducible genomic predictions. By leveraging aggregate statistics databases without storing actual patient data, FASTQs, or any Protected Health Information (PHI), Geneknow ensures complete data privacy while providing clinically relevant insights. The application is entirely free to use with no licensing fees, subscription costs, or commercial restrictions.

This whitepaper outlines Geneknow's architecture, scientific foundation, and value in clinical and research settings.

**Technical/Implementation Details:**
- **Statistical/Investigative Use Only:** Not a diagnostic or clinical tool; see disclaimer above.
- **Privacy-First:** No PHI or raw patient data is stored; all processing is local and offline.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), and Ubuntu Linux.
- **LangGraph Orchestration:** Ensures reproducible, modular, and traceable workflows.
- **No Licensing Fees:** 100% free and open-source, with no commercial restrictions.
- **Extensible Plugin System:** Supports custom ML nodes and analysis modules (infrastructure implemented).

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

**Narrative Overview:**
Genomic data analysis has revolutionized personalized medicine, but traditional cloud-based tools raise significant privacy concerns, with data breaches affecting millions. Regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR demand stringent data protection, yet many solutions require internet connectivity and external servers, limiting accessibility in low-resource or secure environments.

Geneknow addresses these challenges with a fully local, offline-capable platform that performs end-to-end genomic risk assessment on the user's device. Motivated by the need for accessible, compliant tools, Geneknow empowers users to analyze genetic variants for cancer risk without compromising privacy.

**Technical/Implementation Details:**
- All analysis is performed on the user's device, with no data ever leaving the machine.
- Designed for researchers and clinicians who need rapid, reproducible, and private genomic risk assessment for investigative purposes.

## 3. System Overview

**Narrative Overview:**
Geneknow employs a hybrid architecture combining Tauri's lightweight Rust core for system integration, a React-based frontend for intuitive user interaction, and a Python backend for ML-driven analysis. The system uses LangGraph to manage complex workflows, ensuring accurate predictions through modular, traceable node-based processing.

- **Input Handling:** Supports FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and MAF via secure, local file uploads with compressed format support (.gz extensions).
- **Processing Pipeline:** LangGraph-orchestrated nodes for variant calling, annotation, and risk scoring through 15 specialized processing nodes.

## LangGraph Pipeline Architecture

Geneknow’s core analysis pipeline is orchestrated using LangGraph, a modular, node-based workflow engine. This architecture enables reproducible, auditable, and privacy-preserving genomic analysis by chaining together discrete processing steps—each implemented as a node in the pipeline. The pipeline is divided into two phases:

- **Phase 1: Offline Model Training & Validation** (performed before shipping the app)
- **Phase 2: Online Real-Time Inference Pipeline** (runs locally in the app)

Below is a high-level diagram of the pipeline, followed by a detailed explanation of each node and its implementation in the codebase.

**How It Works:**
- **Phase 1** (Offline): Models are trained and validated on public/clinical data, producing a validated artifact that is bundled with the app.
- **Phase 2** (Online): User uploads a file, which is validated, parsed, and processed through a series of nodes—each responsible for a specific analysis step. Features are extracted, risk is assessed, explainability is performed, and results are formatted for user review and export. All processing is local, with no data leaving the device.

Each node is implemented as a Python module in `geneknow_pipeline/nodes/`, with clear logging and modular design for extensibility and auditability. For more details, see the code references above or the pipeline documentation.

## 5. Privacy & Security Design

**Narrative Overview:**
Geneknow's HIPAA-friendly architecture processes all data locally, eliminating transmission risks and ensuring zero PHI storage. Features include encrypted temporary storage and automatic data cleanup post-analysis. While not formally HIPAA-certified, the design aligns with HIPAA technical safeguards including access controls and audit logs. The application bundles a complete Python runtime and dependencies to ensure no external dependencies are required during analysis. As a completely free and open-source solution, Geneknow removes cost barriers to genomic analysis while maintaining the highest privacy standards.

- **Performance:**
  - FASTQ: ~0.7-1.0s for 500 reads
  - VCF: ~0.02s for direct variant loading
  - Total pipeline: <1s for most inputs
- **Validation:** AUC >0.85 for cancer risk prediction (see `README.md`, `test_pipeline_comprehensive.py`)
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test scripts, no mock data, real-world validation

## 8. Applications & Case Studies

**Narrative Overview:**
In clinical settings, Geneknow aids risk stratification for patients with suspected hereditary cancer syndromes. Research applications include batch processing for cohort studies, all performed offline.
