# GenePredict Whitepaper Outline

## 1. Executive Summary
- Brief overview of GenePredict: mission, value proposition, and target users
- Key differentiators: privacy-first, local-only, HIPAA/GDPR compliance, AI/ML innovation
- Summary of clinical, research, and economic value

## 2. Introduction & Motivation
- The privacy crisis in genomic analysis
- Limitations of cloud-based solutions (privacy, compliance, cost, accessibility)
- The need for local-first, compliant, and accessible genomic tools
- GenePredict’s mission and vision

## 3. System Overview
- High-level architecture diagram (desktop app, local ML pipeline, no external data flow)
- User workflow diagram (file upload → analysis → report → export)
- Value proposition summary

## 4. Technical Architecture
### 4.1 Frontend
- React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Tauri integration
- UI/UX principles: accessibility, multilingual support, responsive design
### 4.2 Backend
- Rust (Tauri), Python (ML/data), Flask+SocketIO API server
- Data flow: drag-and-drop upload, local ML pipeline, report generation
### 4.3 ML Pipeline
- CADD scoring, ClinVar annotation, PRS, pathway burden, TCGA mapping, ML fusion, SHAP validation
- LLM-driven report generation (multi-language)
### 4.4 Security & Privacy
- Local-only processing, strict file permissions, CSP, input validation
- Logging, audit, and reproducibility features
### 4.5 Extensibility
