# Geneknow: A Privacy-First Local Genomic Risk Assessment Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

Geneknow is a completely free and open-source desktop application designed for privacy-preserving genomic risk assessment, enabling clinicians and researchers to analyze genetic data entirely on local hardware without external data transmission. Built on a Tauri-based architecture with React frontend, Rust integration, and Python ML backend, it processes formats such as FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and MAF to generate interpretable risk reports for specific cancers including blood, breast, colon, lung, and prostate, with potential for future expansion.

Key differentiators include its HIPAA-friendly design (not formally HIPAA-compliant), cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, macOS Intel), and use of LangGraph for orchestrating accurate, reproducible genomic predictions. By leveraging aggregate statistics databases without storing actual patient data, FASTQs, or any Protected Health Information (PHI), Geneknow ensures complete data privacy while providing clinically relevant insights. The application is entirely free to use with no licensing fees, subscription costs, or commercial restrictions.

This whitepaper outlines Geneknow's architecture, scientific foundation, and value in clinical and research settings.

## 2. Introduction & Motivation

Genomic data analysis has revolutionized personalized medicine, but traditional cloud-based tools raise significant privacy concerns, with data breaches affecting millions [1]. Regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR demand stringent data protection, yet many solutions require internet connectivity and external servers, limiting accessibility in low-resource or secure environments [2].

Geneknow addresses these challenges with a fully local, offline-capable platform that performs end-to-end genomic risk assessment on the user's device. Motivated by the need for accessible, compliant tools, Geneknow empowers users to analyze genetic variants for cancer risk without compromising privacy.

## 3. System Overview

Geneknow employs a hybrid architecture combining Tauri's lightweight Rust core for system integration, a React-based frontend for intuitive user interaction, and a Python backend for ML-driven analysis. The system uses LangGraph to manage complex workflows, ensuring accurate predictions through modular, traceable node-based processing [3].

- **Input Handling:** Supports FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and MAF via secure, local file uploads with compressed format support (.gz extensions).
- **Processing Pipeline:** LangGraph-orchestrated nodes for variant calling, annotation, and risk scoring through 15 specialized processing nodes.
- **Output:** Comprehensive reports with visualizations, exportable in PDF and JSON formats.
- **Privacy Architecture:** All data remains on-device; no network calls post-installation.

Cross-platform compatibility is achieved through Tauri's bundling, with Rust handling low-level operations for efficiency.

## 4. Core Technologies & Architecture

### 4.1 LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

Geneknow's backend leverages LangGraph for deterministic workflow management, ensuring reproducibility in genomic predictions. The pipeline consists of 15 nodes including file input, variant calling, quality control, population mapping, TCGA mapping, CADD scoring, ClinVar annotation, PRS calculation, pathway burden analysis, ML fusion, and report generation, connected in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for efficient parallel execution [4].

### 4.2 Machine Learning Pipeline

The ML pipeline integrates ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression) trained on aggregate data from TCGA and COSMIC, avoiding patient-specific information [5]. SHAP values provide interpretability, explaining model decisions for clinical trust [6]. The ML fusion layer combines outputs from five static models to produce final risk assessments.

### 4.3 Static Models and Metrics

Geneknow employs five static models to compute risk metrics, each producing specific outputs for comprehensive analysis [7]:

- **Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** Aggregates common variant effects from GWAS studies into standardized scores for six cancer types (BRCA, OVCA, PRAD, LUAD, COAD, PANCA), with population-specific effect sizes and confidence adjustments based on SNP coverage.
- **ClinVar Annotation:** Classifies variants using a local SQLite database with clinical significance scores (Pathogenic: 1.0, Likely Pathogenic: 0.8, etc.) and cancer-specific scoring bonuses.
- **CADD Scoring:** Provides deleteriousness scores (PHRED-scaled, higher indicates more deleterious) for SNVs and indels, with cancer gene multipliers and quality adjustments [9].
- **TCGA Mapper:** Maps variants to TCGA cohorts using a database of 2,828 patient samples, computing frequency-based risk multipliers and tumor enrichment evidence.
- **Pathway Burden Analysis:** Calculates pathway disruption scores (0-100%) for cancer-related pathways including DNA repair, tumor suppressors, oncogenes, cell cycle, and chromatin remodeling, with overall burden aggregation.

These metrics fuse through an ML fusion layer into a unified risk profile, validated against real datasets.

### 4.4 Plugin System

A plugin system is currently in development, with infrastructure partially implemented including plugin traits, registry, and manifest-based configuration. The system will allow extensibility for custom ML nodes when fully operational.

### 4.5 Data Management

Geneknow uses SQLite databases containing aggregate statistics from public sources (e.g., gnomAD, ClinVar, TCGA), ensuring no raw patient data, Protected Health Information (PHI), or actual genomic sequences are stored [10]. The population variants database contains only frequency data and clinical annotations derived from public datasets, maintaining complete privacy by design.

## 5. Privacy & Security Design

Geneknow's HIPAA-friendly architecture processes all data locally, eliminating transmission risks and ensuring zero PHI storage. Features include encrypted temporary storage and automatic data cleanup post-analysis. While not formally HIPAA-certified, the design aligns with HIPAA technical safeguards including access controls and audit logs [11]. The application bundles a complete Python runtime and dependencies to ensure no external dependencies are required during analysis. As a completely free and open-source solution, Geneknow removes cost barriers to genomic analysis while maintaining the highest privacy standards.

## 6. User Interface and Experience
