# üß™ GenePredict ‚Äì Tech Stack & Dev Assignment

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Platform
- **Tauri**: For building a secure, cross-platform desktop app (macOS, Windows, Ubuntu).
- **React + Tailwind CSS**: Modern UI with fast iteration and good dev velocity.
- **Rust (via Tauri)**: For secure, performant native functionality and file handling (FASTQ, BAM).
- **Python (via Tauri plugin)**: For invoking ML workflows, TensorFlow, and Llama 3.1.
- **No External Backend**: All inference runs locally for privacy and compliance.

### Genomic Processing & AI
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning for genomic risk scoring.
- **OpenMined PySyft**: Differential privacy on ML models.
- **Llama 3.1 (via HuggingFace or local model runner)**: For generating readable reports.
- **Samtools / BioPython / pysam**: For FASTQ/BAM parsing and variant extraction.
- **DeepVariant**: For variant calling if needed.
