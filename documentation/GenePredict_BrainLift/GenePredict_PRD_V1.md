# Project Name
## GenePredict: AI for Genomic Risk Assessment

## Project Description
GenePredict is an open-source, AI-powered platform that analyzes genomic data to predict disease risks (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases) and delivers interpretable risk reports for clinicians and patients. Built using Llama 3.1 405B for NLP and TensorFlow for ML, it integrates with open-access genomic databases (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project) and EHRs. The tool includes a React + Tailwind CSS web interface to visualize risk profiles and is optimized for local use (compliant with GDPR/HIPAA). It enables precision medicine in low-resource settings and supports multilingual, bias-aware reporting.

## Target Audience
- Clinicians in academic hospitals and rural/low-resource clinics
- Bioinformatics researchers and ML scientists
- NGOs and global health organizations
- Patients seeking personalized genomic insights (future phase)

## Desired Features
### Genomic Data Analysis
- [ ] VCF file upload and parsing
    - [ ] Client-side pre-check for file validity
- [ ] Risk prediction pipeline (TensorFlow-based)
    - [ ] Uses ClinVar and 1000 Genomes for training and validation
- [ ] Variant impact analysis and mapping

### Report Generation
- [ ] Llama 3.1-based interpretable risk report
    - [ ] Highlights top variant risks
    - [ ] Summarizes risk in layperson and clinician-friendly formats
    - [ ] Supports multilingual output (20+ languages)
- [ ] Downloadable PDF or print-ready report

### Privacy & Compliance
- [ ] Local deployment (Docker)
    - [ ] Offline processing of genomic data
- [ ] Differential privacy (OpenMined PySyft)
- [ ] No data ever leaves user environment

### Visual Interface (Web UI)
- [ ] Risk heatmap (per gene/variant)
- [ ] Variant-level visualization with severity scores
- [ ] Searchable variant table
- [ ] “Risk Explorer” mode for interactive exploration of sample profiles

### Developer/Research Extensibility
- [ ] Modular codebase with clear API layers
- [ ] GitHub-first project structure
- [ ] Dataset/model plug-and-play structure

## Design Requests
- [ ] Modern, accessible UI using Tailwind CSS
    - [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
    - [ ] Clinician-friendly fonts and contrast
- [ ] Mobile-responsiveness (dashboard view for tablets)
- [ ] Animation or feedback for file uploads and predictions

## Other Notes
- Core innovation: combining TensorFlow-based genomic risk models with interpretable LLM-generated reporting
- Demo will include a fictional patient journey
- Emphasis on equity, global health access, and bias mitigation
